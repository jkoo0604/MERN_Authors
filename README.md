# Authors

### A MERN project where users can add/edit/delete favorite authors (full CRUD)
##### From the MERN stack at Coding Dojo


Objectives:
* Set up server, model, controller, routes, and config files for server (express.js & Mongoose)
* Create a React app for frontend with hooks and components
* Edit form is pre-populated with existing data
* Backend validations for adding and editing authors with error messages
* If a user attempts to make a GET request to the edit form for an author with an unrecognized id, display an error message with link to the add form
* Sort authors
